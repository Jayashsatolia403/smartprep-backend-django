NOTE : Attached Code Sample is only Backend API par.

Introduction: Developed a mobile application from scratch using flutter that helps users to prepare for various competitive exams held in India by providing : Quality daily questions | Weekly Competitions | Practice Questions | Best Question of the Day | Rewarded Questions | Quote of the Day.

Features : 
    1. Smartprep App have 4 types of Subscriptions : Free | Standard | Premium | Ultimate.
